# Available Data Types
  - int: stores a regular integer, defaulting to 32 bits in size
  - double: holds a large floating point number
  - float: holds a smaller floating point number
  - char: holds a single 1 byte character
  - void: indicates "no type" and used to say a function returns nothing or a pointer has no type
  - enum: enumerated types, work as integers, convert to integers, but give you symbolic names for sets. 

# Type Modifiers
  - unsigned: changes the type so that it does not have negative numbers, giving you a larger upper bound, but
    nothing lower than 0
  - signed: gives you negative and positive numbers, but halves your upper bound in exchange for the same
    lower bound negative
  - long: uses a larger storage for the type so that it can hold bigger numbers, usually doubling the current
    size
  - short: uses smaller storage for the type so it tores less, but takes half the space

# Type Qualifiers
  - const: indicates the variable will not change after being initialized
  - volatile: indicates that all bets are off, and the compiler should leave this alone and try not to do any
    fancy optimizations to it. Only need this if you are doing really weird stuff to your variables.
  - register: forces the compiler to keep this variable in a register, and the compiler can just ignore you,
    only use this if you actually can measure it improving the speed

# Type Conversion
  - C uses a sort of "stepped type promotion" mechanism, where it looks at two operands on either side of an
    expression, and promotes the smaller side to match the larger side before doing the operation. 
    If one side of the operation is on the following list then the other side is converted to that type 
    before the operation is done and this goes in order.
      -- long double
      -- double
      -- float
      -- int (but only char and short int)
      -- long
  - If you find yourself trying to figure out how your conversions are working in an expression, do not leave
    it to the compiler, use explicit casting.
  - long + char - int * double == (double)long - (double)char - (double)int * double
  - IMPORTANT thing to remember is to always promote up, not down. Do not case a long into a char unless you
    know what you are doing

# Type Sizes
  - int8_t: 8 bit signed integer
  - uint8_t: 8 bit unsigned integer
  - int16_t: 16 bit signed integer
  - uint16_t: 16 bit signed integer
  - int32_t: 32 bit signed integer
  - uint32_t: 32 bit signed integer
  - int64_t: 64 bit signed integer
  - uint64_t: 64 bit signed integer
  - INT(N)_MAX MACRO -- returns maximum positive number of the signed integer of N bits
  - INT(N)_MIN MACRO -- returns minimum positive number of the signed integer of N bits
  - UINT(N)_MAX MACRO -- returns maximum positive number of the unsigned integer of N bits
